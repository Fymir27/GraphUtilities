# GraphUtilities

A .NET library for creating and using undirected graphs

## Installing / Getting started

Option 1:
Build the .dll yourself by opening the VisualStudio solution (GraphUtilities.sln) and building it (F7)

Option 2:
Copy GraphUtilities/Graph.cs into your project (it's just one file)

## Developing

GraphUtilitiesTest contains Unit Test for the library if you ever want to modify it

## Features

The class Graph represents an UNDIRECTED mathematical graph consisting of vertices and edges
  * Vertices and edges are saved as objects and can each contain arbitrary data
  * Allows having vertices that are not connected to anything
  * Does not yet support vertices having an edge to themselves (no loops!)
